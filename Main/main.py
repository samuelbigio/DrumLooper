"""

Moving forward i want to create a dynamic grid for each instrument
each instrument should have a picture and then eight buttons
the grid should be dynamic with how many instruments/buttons

i want the instruments buttons to be pressable and then add bits for the state
if the bits are on i want that to play in tempo
if the bits are off nothing happens

i wantt a marker to follow the bpm (this is optional)

if i have enough time i want a drop down to pick instruments (this wont matter in hardware so it might be waste of time)
